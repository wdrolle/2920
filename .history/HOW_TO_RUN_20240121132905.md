
# Merging Client and Server `package.json` Files into Root Level `package.json`

## Step 1: Initialize `package.json` at the Root Level
Navigate to the root of your `Blog-Website` directory and initialize a new `package.json` file.

```bash
cd ~/Blog-Website
npm init -y
```

## Step 2: Merge Dependencies
Combine the dependencies from both `client/package.json` and `server/package.json` into the root `package.json`. Check for any version conflicts and resolve them.

**Root `package.json` (Add the dependencies section):**

```json
{
  "name": "ai",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently \"cd client && npm start\" \"cd server && npm start\"",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "client-start": "cd client && react-scripts start",
    "client-build": "cd client && react-scripts build",
    "client-test": "cd client && react-scripts test",
    "client-eject": "cd client && react-scripts eject",
    "server-start": "cd server && nodemon index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "keywords": [],
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "@emotion/react": "^11.9.0",
    "@emotion/styled": "^11.8.1",
    "@mui/icons-material": "^5.8.0",
    "@mui/material": "^5.8.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.7",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.8.3",
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "bcrypt": "^5.0.1",
    "body-parser": "^1.20.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.1",
    "express": "^4.18.1",
    "gridfs-stream": "^1.1.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1",
    "mongoose": "^6.3.4",
    "multer": "^1.4.4",
    "multer-gridfs-storage": "^5.0.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.16",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "web-vitals": "^1.1.2"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Merge Scripts
Update the scripts in the root `package.json` to include the scripts from both client and server. Use `concurrently` to run both client and server scripts.

**Root `package.json` (Add the scripts section):**

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently "cd client && npm start" "cd server && npm start"",
  "client-script1": "cd client && script-command",
  "server-script1": "cd server && script-command",
  ...
}
```

## Step 4: Install Concurrently
Install `concurrently` to run multiple commands simultaneously.

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

## Step 5: Install Dependencies
Run `npm install` at the root level to install all combined dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 6: Start the Application
Now, you can start both the client and server by running the start script from the root of your project.

```bash
npm start
```

**Note:** Make sure to test the application thoroughly to ensure both client and server are functioning correctly after these changes.
