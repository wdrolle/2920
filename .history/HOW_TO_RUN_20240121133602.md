
# Merging Client and Server `package.json` Files into Root Level `package.json`

## Step 1: Initialize `package.json` at the Root Level
Navigate to the root of your `Blog-Website` directory and initialize a new `package.json` file.

```bash
cd ~/Blog-Website
npm init -y
```

## Step 2: Merge Dependencies
Combine the dependencies from both `client/package.json` and `server/package.json` into the root `package.json`. Check for any version conflicts and resolve them.

**Root `package.json` (Add the dependencies section):**

```json
"dependencies": {
  // Combined dependencies from client and server
  "dependency1": "^version",
  "dependency2": "^version",
  ...
}
```

## Step 3: Merge Scripts
Update the scripts in the root `package.json` to include the scripts from both client and server. Use `concurrently` to run both client and server scripts.

**Root `package.json` (Add the scripts section):**

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently "cd client && npm start" "cd server && npm start"",
  "client-script1": "cd client && script-command",
  "server-script1": "cd server && script-command",
  ...
}
```

## Step 4: Install Concurrently
Install `concurrently` to run multiple commands simultaneously.

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

## Step 5: Install Dependencies
Run `npm install` at the root level to install all combined dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 6: Start the Application
Now, you can start both the client and server by running the start script from the root of your project.

```bash
npm start
```

**Note:** Make sure to test the application thoroughly to ensure both client and server are functioning correctly after these changes.

# Installing NVM and Node.js v16

## Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
NVM allows you to easily switch between Node.js versions. Install it with:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

## Load NVM
To start using NVM, either restart your terminal or run:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

## Install Node.js Version 16
Once NVM is installed, install Node.js version 16:

```bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

## Verify Node.js Installation
Check your Node.js version to ensure you're using version 16:

```bash
node --version
```

## Uninstalling a Node.js Version (Optional)
If you need to uninstall a specific Node.js version (e.g., v21.6.0) installed via NVM:

```bash
nvm uninstall 21.6.0
```

Verify the uninstallation by listing all installed Node.js versions:

```bash
nvm ls
```
