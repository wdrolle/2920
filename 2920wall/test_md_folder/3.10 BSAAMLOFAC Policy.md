BSA/AML and OFAC Requirements
In her June 12, 2014, Remarks, FinCEN Director BankClient gave this description 
of the BSA:
As you likely already know, the Bank Secrecy Act, or “BSA,” is the common name for a 
series of statutes and regulations that form this country’s anti-money laundering and 
countering the financing of terrorism laws. Nearly every country around the world has 
similar laws in place at this point. These laws are meant to protect the integrity of the 
financial system by leveraging the assistance of financial institutions to make it more
transparent and resilient to crime and security threats, and by providing information 
useful to law enforcement and others to combat such threats.
The USA PATRIOT Act (2001) and 31 CFR Chapter X (2011) are among the BSA’s more recent 
and prominent statutes and regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act is one of several statutes 
referenced by the title Bank Secrecy Act. 31 CFR Chapter X contains the organized codification 
of BSA regulations. (The BSA’s implementing regulations organized by financial industry.)
As defined in 31 CFR Part 1010.1 OO(ff), MSB activities include (with certain limitations): 
dealings in foreign exchange; check cashing services; issuance or sales of traveler’s checks or 
money orders; provision of prepaid access services; money transmittal services; certain activities 
of the U.S. Postal Service; and sales of prepaid access.
Regulations governing these activities are found in 31 CFR Part 1022, Rules for Money Services 
Businesses. These regulations are divided into four main sections:
1) Programs (§1022.210). An MSB's AML program must include policies, procedures, and 
internal controls for:
a. Verifying customer identities;
b. Filing reports;
c. Creating and retaining records;
d. Responding to law enforcement requests.
2) Report Filings. MSBs are required to file various reports with FinCEN. These filings 
include reports of suspicious activities (SARs), currency transaction reports (CTRs); 
MSB registration (MSBR);
3) Maintenance of Records; and
4) Information Sharing.
A Note about OFAC: As an office of the US Treasury Department, the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (“OFAC”) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted 
foreign countries, organizations, and individuals. OFAC imposes controls on transactions and 
freezes assets under US jurisdiction. While OFAC sanctions are not part of the BSA, OFAC 
screenings are often conducted in conjunction with a financial institution’s BSA-compliance 
activities.
c. Money Laundering Description
Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the 
true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from 
legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in three 
stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the "placement" stage, where the cash generated 
from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or 
traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the 
funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further 
separate the money from its criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced 
into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or 
legitimate businesses.

Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to 
conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could be for criminal purposes. 
Legitimate sources of funds are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional 
criminal organizations. In addition to charitable donations, legitimate sources include foreign 
government sponsors, business ownership and personal employment. Although the motivation 
differs between traditional money launderers and terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to 
fund terrorist operations can be the same as or similar to methods used by other criminals to 
launder funds. Funding for terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of money and the 
associated transactions may not be complex.
1. MSB Registration (31 CFR § 1022.380)
a. Registration
We are currently registered with FinCEN as an MSB. Our MSB registration number is 
1. b. Registration Records
We shall retain a copy of the filed MSB registration form and other supporting documentation at 
the following US address:
3300 Central Expy, STE B
Santa Clara, CA 95051
We shall retain these registration documents for a period of at least five years.
c. Registration Renewal
We shall renew our registration by the end (December 31) of the second calendar year following 
our initial registration and by December 31 of every second calendar year thereafter.
d. Events Requiring Re-registration
If any of the following events occurs during a registration period (more than 180 days before the 
next renewal date), we shall re-file a registration form with information different from that 
reported on the form originally filed:
Change in Ownership or Control under State Law. There has been a change in ownership or 
control of the MSB that requires the MSB to be re-registered under State law.
Transfer of Voting Power or Equity Interest. More than 10 percent of the voting power or equity 
interest of the MSB has been transferred (except MSBs that must report such transfer to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission);

Increase in the Number of Agents. The number of agents of the MSB has increased by more than 
50 percent.
To re-register, we shall complete and file an RMSB no later than 180 days after the date on which 
the triggering event occurred.
e. List of Agents
We do not have any agents at this time and it may not apply to our current state. If it applies in 
the future, we shall prepare and maintain a list of our agents. We shall update this list by January 
1 of each year. We shall make our list of agents available to FinCEN, as well as other appropriate 
law enforcement agencies, including the IRS, upon request. Our agent list shall include:
• Name: The name of the agent, including any trade names or doing-business-as names.
• Address: The address of the agent, including street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
• Type of Services: The type of MSB services the agent provides on our behalf.
• Gross Transaction Amount: A listing of the individual months in the 12 months 
preceding the date of the agent list in which the agent’s gross transaction amount, for 
financial products or services issued by our firm, exceeded $100,000.
• Depository Institution: Name and address of any depository institution at which the agent 
maintains a transaction account for any of the funds received in or for the MSB services 
the agent provides on our behalf.
• Year Became Agent: The year in which the agent first became our agent.
• Branches: The number of branches and sub-agents the agent has, if any.
1. Risk Management
We have identified our BSA/AML and OFAC risks regarding products & services, customers & 
entities, and geographic locations.
a. Product & Service Risks
Our own services and third party services that we rely on may fail due to internal or external 
reasons. Our mitigating methods will make sure the residual risk is under our tolerance.
b. Customer & Entity Risks
Our clients may intend to deceive us by identify' fraud or other activities. Our internal control 
methods and automated system will prevent such activities from happening at the earliest stage.
c. Geographic Location Risks
Our clients may show evidence that they are related to any high-risk locations or jurisdictions. 
Our enhanced due diligence will identify such relationships, and reject or terminate those clients’ 
accounts accordingly.
7

We provide a detailed risk analysis table in our risk assessment file.
1. Giving AML Information to Federal Law Enforcement
Agencies and Other Financial Institutions
a. FinCEN Requests under USA PATRIOT Act Section 314(a)
As of the latest update to these procedures, FinCEN did not make regular 314(a) requests of most 
MSBs. Should FinCEN ever make a 314(a) request of our firm, we shall implement the following 
policies and procedures:
Upon receiving an information request under 31 C.F.R. § 1010.520, we shall designate one 
person to be the point of contact regarding the request and to receive similar requests for 
information from FinCEN in the future. When requested by FinCEN, we shall provide FinCEN 
with the name, title, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and facsimile number of 
such person, in such manner as FinCEN may prescribe. After providing FinCEN with this contact 
information, we shall promptly notify FinCEN of any changes to such information.
As required by 31 C.F.R. § 1010.520(a)(3), “upon receiving an information request from FinCEN 
under [§ 1010.520, we shall] expeditiously search [our] records to determine whether [we 
maintain] or [have] maintained any account for, or [have] engaged in any transaction with, each 
individual, entity, or organization named in FinCEN’s request/’ If we find a match, our AML 
Compliance Officer will report it to FinCEN via FinCEN’s Web-based 314(a) Secure Information 
Sharing System within 14 days or within the time requested by FinCEN in the request. If the 
search parameters differ from those mentioned above (for example, if FinCEN limits the search to 
a geographic location), our AML Compliance Officer will structure our search accordingly.
When we search our records but do not find a matching account or transaction, we will not reply 
to the 314(a) request. We will maintain documentation that we have performed the required 
search by printing a search self-verification document from FinCEN’s 314(a) Secure Information 
Sharing System evidencing that we have searched the 314(a) subject information against our 
records.
We will not disclose the fact that FinCEN has requested or obtained information from us, except 
to the extent necessary to comply with the information request. Our AML Compliance Officer 
will review, maintain and implement procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of 
requests from FinCEN similar to those procedures established to satisfy the requirements of 
Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act with regard to the protection of customers’ 
nonpublic information.
We will direct any questions we have about the 314(a) request to the requesting federal law 
enforcement agency as designated in the request. Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) request, 
we will not be required to treat the information request as continuing in nature, and we will not be 
required to treat the periodic 314(a) Requests as a government provided list of suspected terrorists 
for purposes of the customer identification and verification requirements.
8

b. Voluntary Information Sharing with Other Financial Institutions 
under USA PATRIOT Act, Section 314(b) (31 C.F.R. § 1010.540)
We may share information with other financial institutions regarding individuals, entities, 
organizations and countries for purposes of identifying and, where appropriate, reporting 
activities that we suspect may involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering. Before 
doing so, our AML Compliance Officer will ensure that the firm files with FinCEN an initial 
notice before any sharing occurs and annual notices thereafter. We will use the notice form found 
at FinCEN's Web site. Before we share information with another financial institution, we will 
take reasonable steps to verify that the other financial institution has submitted the requisite 
notice to FinCEN, either by obtaining confirmation from the financial institution or by consulting 
a list of such financial institutions that FinCEN will make available. We understand that this 
requirement applies even to financial institutions with which we are affiliated. As with non­
affiliated firms, we will also obtain the requisite notices from affiliates and follow all required 
procedures.
We will employ strict procedures both to ensure that only relevant information is shared and to 
protect the security and confidentiality of this information.
We also will employ procedures to ensure that any information received from another financial 
institution shall not be used for any purpose other than:
• identifying and, where appropriate, reporting on money laundering or terrorist activities;
• determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to engage in a transaction; or
• assisting the financial institution in complying with performing such activities.
1. System of Internal Controls
a. Customer Identification Program (31 C.F.R. § 1022.210(d)
As a provider of cross-border, business payment services, BankClient will only deal with business 
entity customers. BankClient will not provide services to individual persons.
To satisfy the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements found in 31 C.F.R. § 
1022.210(d)(1) and § 1022.410, we shall collect and verify certain identifying information for 
each business entity who effects a covered transaction with our firm. We shall record customer 
identification information and the verification methods and results.
Covered Transactions
Following is a list of covered transaction activities in which our firm may engage:
• Foreign exchange.
• Money transmittals.
Required Customer Information
9

Before effecting any transaction, we will record the name, address and taxpayer identification 
number of the entity.
Verifying Information
To comply with the requirements of 1022.210(d)(1) and § 1022.410, we will use risk-based 
procedures to verify the identity of each customer. We may verify the customer's identity by 
reviewing a formal document, such as: certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, or a financial statement. We may also use an online identity verification service 
such as Blockscore (https://blockscorc.com/), FacelD (https://faceid.com/), or Qi Cha Cha 
(http://www.qichacha.com/).
Recordkeeping
We will document our verification, including all identifying information provided by a customer, 
the methods used and results of verification, and the resolution of any discrepancies identified in 
the verification process. We will keep records containing a description of any document that we 
relied on to verify a customer’s identity, noting the type of document, any identification number 
contained in the document, the place of issuance, and if any, the date of issuance and expiration 
date. With respect to non-documentary verification, we will retain documents that describe the 
methods and the results of any measures we took to verify the identity of a customer. We will 
also keep records containing a description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained. We will retain records of all 
identification information for five years after the date on which the transaction was effected; we 
will retain records made about verification of the customer's identity for five years after the 
record is made.
b. Know Your Merchant
Before providing any money transmittal or foreign exchange services to a business entity, 
BankClient will verify the legitimacy of the entity. As described above, verification will be 
performed through our use of an online identity verification system. We shall perform such 
verification actions to enable us to form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of each 
business entity customer.
c. Enhanced Customer Due Diligence
For accounts we have deemed to be high risk using our risk score table and other methodologies, 
we will conduct enhanced due diligence, and obtain including but not limited to the following 
information:
• The source of funds;
• The beneficial owners of the business;
• The customers' clients list;
• Financial statements and banking references;
• Contracts or other proof of documents associated with each transaction.
d. Checking the Office of Foreign Assets Control Listings
10

Although not part of the BSA and its implementing regulations, Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) compliance is often performed in conjunction with AML compliance. OFAC is an office 
of the U.S. Treasury that administers and enforces economic sanctions and embargoes based on 
U.S. foreign policy and national security goals that target geographic regions and governments 
(e.g., Cuba, Sudan and Syria), as well as individuals or entities that could be anywhere (e.g., 
international narcotics traffickers, foreign terrorists and proliferators of weapons of mass 
destruction). As part of its enforcement efforts. OFAC publishes a list of Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN list), which includes names of companies and individuals 
who are connected with the sanctions targets. U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with 
SDNs wherever they are located, and all SDN assets must be blocked.
Before conducting a transaction of any amount, we will check to ensure that a customer does not 
appear on the SDN list or is not engaging in transactions that are prohibited by the economic 
sanctions and embargoes administered and enforced by OFAC. To perform these checks, we may 
use the OFAC’s Sanctions List Search application found at
https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/. Because the SDN list and listings of economic 
sanctions and embargoes are updated frequently, we will consult them on a regular basis and 
subscribe to receive any available updates when they occur. We will also document our reviews.
If we determine that a customer is on the SDN list or there is a possible match or is engaging in 
transactions that are prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and 
enforced by OFAC, we will reject the money transmittal request and/or block the customer's 
assets and file a blocked assets and/or rejected transaction form with OFAC within 10 days. We 
will also call the OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 immediately.
e. Monitoring Transactions for Suspicious Activity (31 C.F.R. 
§ 1022.320(a))
Transaction Reviews
To ensure our attentiveness to money laundering and terrorist financing activities, we will review 
all transactions conducted or attempted by, at or through our firm (including transactions 
conducted with agents) involving $2,000 or more of funds or assets (either individually or in the 
aggregate).
On a monthly basis, we will complete a transaction review form (“TRF”), on which we will 
document our reviews. To evidence our compliance with our requirement to identify and report 
suspicious transactions, we will maintain copies of our TRFs for at least five years from the date 
of the review.
Red Flags
We will use a Transaction Review Form (“TRF”) to document our reviews of transactions. With 
our TRF, we will consider whether or not a transaction has, at a minimum, any of the red flags 
identified by FinCEN in its publication: Money Laundering Prevention: A Money Services 
Business Guide (https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/guidance/msb prevention guide.pdQ:
Red flags that signal possible money laundering or terrorist financing include, but are not 
limited to:
11

Customer ID or Information
• Customer uses false ID.
• Two/more customers use similar IDs.
• Customer alters transaction upon learning that he/she must show ID.
• Customer alters spelling or order of his/her full name.
Transactions Below Reporting or Recordkeeping Thresholds
• Customer conducts transactions just below relevant thresholds:
• Currency exchanges just under $ 1.000.
Multiple Customers or Locations
• Two or more customers working together to break one transaction into two or more 
transactions in order to evade the BSA reporting or recordkeeping requirement.
• Customer uses two or more locations or cashiers in the same day in order to break 
one transaction into smaller transactions and evade the BSA reporting or 
recordkeeping requirement.
Overt Illegal Customer Conduct
• Customer offers bribes or tips.
• Customer admits to criminal conduct.
Responding to Red Flags and Suspicious Activity
When an employee of the firm detects any red flag, or other activity that may be suspicious, he or 
she will notify our AML Compliance Officer. Under the direction of the AML Compliance 
Officer, the firm will determine whether or not and how to further investigate the matter. This 
may include gathering additional information internally or from third-party sources, contacting 
the government, and/or filing a SAR.
If the activity is initially deemed potentially suspicious but after review, our AML Compliance 
Officer decided that it is not reportable, then we will not file a SAR.
f. Foreign Agents and Counterparties (FinCEN Release No. 2004-
01:
https://www.fmcen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/msbagentadvisor 
ypdf)
We do not have any agents at this time. The following procedures regarding agents may not apply 
to our current state but may apply in the future.
Before entering into a relationship with any foreign agent or foreign counterparty, and on at least 
an annual basis after entering into any such relationship, we shall conduct risk-based due 
diligence and monitoring of activities:
Review Structure and Risk Profile
12

• Location of agent/counterparty - check FATF guidance regarding risks posed by 
jurisdiction.
• Ownership of agent/counterparty - run OFAC check against owners
• Require agent/counterparty to be subject to AML requirements in its jurisdiction and that 
it establish internal controls.
• Use web searches to check for any reports of AML issues with agent/counterparty.
• Review of agent/counterparty's business, the markets it serves, and the extent to which its 
structure presents an increased risk for money laundering or terrorist financing.
• Review the types and purposes of services to be provided to, and anticipated activity
with, the agent/counterparty.
• Consideration of the nature and duration of our relationship with the agent/counterparty.
• Identify material changes in the agent/counterparty's risk profile (ex: ownership, 
business, or the regulatory scrutiny to which it is subject).
Monitoring
• Review of transactions to identify and, where appropriate, report suspicious transactions, 
including:
o unusual wire activity;
o bulk sales or purchases of sequentially numbered instruments; 
o multiple purchases or sales that appear to be structured, and; 
o illegible or missing customer information.
• Review of agent/counterparty AML program to discern obvious breakdowns in the 
implementation of the program by the agent or counterparty.
• Review of agent/counterparty activities for signs of structuring or unnecessarily complex 
transmissions through multiple jurisdictions that may be indicative of layering or of 
efforts to evade detection.
Corrective Action and Termination
Agent/counterparty deficiencies noted in our due-diligence activities will be reported to the 
agent/counterparty. The agent/counterparty must promptly respond to and resolve each identified 
deficiency. Based on our assessment of the risk presented by each identified deficiency, we shall 
work with the agent/counterparty to set a resolution date.
Should an agent or counterparty fail to respond timely or appropriately to an identified 
deficiency, or should our management team determine that an identified deficiency presents an 
unacceptable risk, we shall take immediate actions to temporarily or permanently cease all 
business activities with the agent or counterparty. We shall take such actions should an agent or 
counterparty ever demonstrate systemic, willful, or repeated lapses in compliance with our AML 
procedures or requirements.
1. AML Compliance Officer Designation and Duties (31 
C.F.R. § 1022.210(d)(2))
13

BankClient has designated Xin Huang as its Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Officer (“AML 
Compliance Officer”), with full responsibility for the firm's AML Program. As our AML 
Compliance Officer, Mr. Huang will oversee ail aspects of BankClient’s compliance with AML 
regulations. Mr. Huang has a working knowledge of the BSA and its implementing regulations 
and is qualified by experience, knowledge and training. Mr. Huang has Master of Management 
Science & Engineering degree from Columbia University. He proceeded international accredited 
investors compliance (review and verification) when he was in Meixin Finance Group, a global 
investment company based in New York.
The responsibilities of our AML Compliance Officer shall specifically include assuring that:
• Our firm properly files reports, and creates and retains records, in accordance with 
applicable requirements of the BSA;
• Our AML Program is updated as necessary to reflect current requirements of the BSA, 
and related guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury; and
• Our firm provides appropriate training and education in accordance with 31 C.F.R. 
§ 1022.210(d)(3).
1. Agent Relationships
Citing 31 CFR § 1022.210(d)( 1 )(iii), in its March 11,2016, Guidance, FinCEN explained that, in 
MSB principal-agent relationships, “each MSB remains independently and wholly responsible for 
implementing adequate AML program requirements.”
FinCEN went on to explain that, as the principal MSB, we must “have procedures in place to 
identify those agents conducting activities that appear to lack commercial purpose, lack 
justification, or otherwise are not supported by verifiable documentation. The principal must 
implement risk-based procedures to monitor the agents' transactions to ensure that they are 
legitimate. The procedures must also ensure that, if the agents' transactions trigger reporting or 
recordkeeping requirements, the principal handles the information in accordance w ith regulatory' 
reporting and recordkeeping obligations. In addition, the MSB principal should implement 
procedures for handling non-compliant agents, including agent contract terminations.”
Recognizing our responsibility in each of these areas, even we do not have any agents at this time 
and it may not apply to our current state, we have implemented the following policies, 
procedures, and internal controls if they may apply in the future:
a. Transaction Reviews
We recognize the risks presented to our firm through the actions of our agents. To address these 
risks, we will monitor the activities of our agents.
As noted below, we will review transactions conducted through our agents. In performing these 
reviews, we will be attentive to agent activities that appear to lack commercial purpose, lack 
justification, or otherwise are not supported by verifiable documentation.
14

As part of these reviews, we will confirm that, for agent transactions which trigger BSA reporting 
or recordkeeping requirements, we have created the required records and filed the required 
reports.
b. AML Program Reviews
On at least an annual basis, we will also review the written AML policies and procedures of each 
of our agents. We will perform these reviews to ensure that our agents have effective AML 
programs. An effective AML program will address all relevant BSA requirements including: CIP, 
Transaction Monitoring. BSA Reporting, and Recordkeeping.
c. Agent Transactions - BSA Reporting and Recordkeeping
As specified in this program, BankClient accepts full responsibility for BSA reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements related to BankClient’s MSB activities. Whether transactions are 
conducted directly with us, or whether they are conducted through our agents, we will file all 
required reports and keep all required records.
d. Corrective Action and Termination
Agent deficiencies noted in our due-diligence activities will be reported to the agent. The agent 
must promptly respond to and resolve each identified deficiency. Based on our assessment of the 
risk presented by each identified deficiency, we shall work with the agent to set a resolution date.
Should an agent fail to respond timely or appropriately to an identified deficiency, or should our 
management team determine that an identified deficiency presents an unacceptable risk, we shall 
take immediate actions to temporarily or permanently cease all business activities with the agent. 
We shall take such actions should an agent ever demonstrate systemic, willful, or repeated lapses 
in compliance with our AML procedures or requirements.
1. BSA Reporting
a. Use of the BSA E-Filing System
We shall use the BSA E-Filing System to submit each SAR, CTR. FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR), 
and RMSB as applicable.
b. Currency Transaction Report (“CTR”) (31 C.F.R. § 1010.311)
We prohibit dealing with currency currently. There is little if not zero chance we make a currency 
transaction. Should we make such transactions, we shall implement the following policies and 
procedures:
For each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, by, through or 
to us, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 and which is not between 
our firm and a commercial bank (see § 1010.315), we shall file with FinCEN a CTR. Also, we 
15

will treat multiple transactions involving currency as a single transaction for purposes of 
determining whether to file a CTR if they total more than $10,000 and are made by or on behalf 
of the same customer during any one business day. We shall file a CTR within 15 days following 
the day on which the reportable transaction occurred. We shall retain a copy of each CTR for a 
period of five years from the date of the report.
Identification Required (31 C.F.R. § 1010.312)
Before concluding any transaction with respect to which the filing of a CTR is required, we shall 
verify and record the name and address of the individual presenting the transaction, as well as 
record the identity, account number, and taxpayer identification number, if any, of any entity on 
whose behalf such transaction is to be effected. Verification of the identity of an individual who 
indicates that he or she is an alien or is not a resident of the United States shall be made by 
passport, alien identification card, or other official document evidencing nationality or residence.
In each instance, the specific identifying information used in verifying the identity of the 
customer shall be recorded on the report.
Aggregation (31 C.F.R. § 1010.313)
In determining whether or not we are obligated to file any CTR, we shall aggregate all transaction 
activities.
We shall treat multiple currency transactions as a single transaction if we have knowledge that 
these transactions are made by or on behalf of any customer and result in either cash in or cash 
out totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day.
c. Report of Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments 
(“CMIR”) (31 C.F.R. § 1010.340)
As required by 31 C.F.R. § 1010.340, we shall file a CMIR with the Commissioner of Customs if 
we discover that we have received or caused or attempted to receive from outside of the U.S. 
currency or other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 at one time. 
We shall file such report within 15 days after receipt of the currency or other monetary 
instruments.
We shall also file a CMIR if we discover that we have physically transported, mailed or shipped 
or caused or attempted to physically transport, mail or ship by any means currency or other 
monetary instruments of more than $10,000 at one time. We shall file such report at the time of 
departure, mailing or shipping from the United States.
d. Report of Foreign Financial Accounts (31 C.F.R. § 1010.350 and
420)
As of the date of this program, we have no financial interest in, or signature or other authority 
over, a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign country.
Should we ever have a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, a bank, securities, 
or other financial account in a foreign country, we shall report such relationship to the
16

Commissioner of Internal Revenue for each year in which such relationship exists and shall 
provide such information as shall be specified in a reporting form prescribed under 31 U.S.C. 
1. The form prescribed under section 5314 is the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial 
Accounts (FinCEN Form 114 or “FBAR”).
We shall file all FBARs with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on or before June 30 of each 
calendar year with respect to foreign financial accounts exceeding $10,000 maintained during the 
previous calendar year. We shall retain such records for a period of five years and shall keep them 
at all times available for inspection as authorized by law.
e. SAR Filing (31 C.F.R. § 1022.320)
We will file a SAR with FinCEN for any transactions conducted or attempted by, at or through 
our firm involving $2,000 or more of funds or assets (either individually or in the aggregate) 
where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction:
• involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or conducted in order to hide or 
disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activity as part of a plan to violate or evade 
federal law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under federal 
law or regulation;
• is designed, whether through structuring or otherwise, to evade any requirements of the 
BSA regulations;
• serves no business or apparent lawful purpose, and after examining the available facts, 
including the background and possible purpose of the transaction, we know of no 
reasonable explanation for the transaction; or
• involves the use of the firm to facilitate criminal activity.
We may voluntarily file a SAR for any suspicious transaction that we believe is relevant to the 
possible violation of any law or regulation but that is not required to be reported by us under the 
SAR rule. It is our policy that all SARs will be reported regularly to the Board of Directors and 
appropriate senior management, with a clear reminder of the need to maintain the confidentiality 
of the SAR.
We will file a SAR no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of the facts 
that constitute a basis for filing a SAR. The phrase “initial detection'’ does not mean the moment 
a transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day period begins when an appropriate review is 
conducted and a determination is made that the transaction under review is “suspicious” within 
the meaning of the SAR requirements. A review must be initiated promptly upon identification of 
unusual activity that warrants investigation.
f. Emergency Notification to Law Enforcement by Telephone (31
F.C.R. § 1022.320(b)(3))
In situations involving violations that require immediate attention, such as ongoing money 
laundering schemes, we will immediately call an appropriate law enforcement authority. In 
addition to local law enforcement authorities, we may also contact FinCEN’s Financial 
Institutions Hotline (866.556.3974) to report transactions relating to terrorist activity. If we notify 
the appropriate law' enforcement authority of any such activity, we must still file a timely SAR.
17

g. Joint Filing of SARs with Other Financial Institutions (31 C.F.R. 
§ 1022.320)
If we and one or more other party have an obligation to report a transaction, we may file a single 
SAR jointly with the other party.
When filing jointly, we will ensure that the filed SAR contains all relevant facts, including the 
name of each party involved in the transaction. We will also ensure that the SAR complies with 
all instructions applicable to joint filings, and that we keep a copy of the report filed, along with 
any supporting documentation.
If we determine it is appropriate to jointly file a SAR, we understand that we cannot disclose that 
we have filed a SAR to any party except the party that is filing jointly. If we determine it is not 
appropriate to file jointly (e.g., because the SAR concerns the other party or one of its 
employees), we understand that we cannot disclose that we have filed a SAR to any party.
1. BSA Recordkeeping
We will keep all required records (including C1P records, SAR filings, KYC, Program, policies 
and procedures, training, training logs, and other required records) for at least five years.
a. Required Records of Funds Transmittals (31 C.F.R. § 1010.410)

for a recipient that is not an established customer, in addition to obtaining and retaining the 
information required by 31 C.F.R. § 1010.410(e)( 1 )(iii), we shall also obtain the information

As the transmitter's financial institution, we shall retain information in a format that shall allow 
us to retrieve the information by reference to the name of the transmitter. If the transmitter is an

shall be retrievable by account number.
As the recipient’s financial institution, we shall retain information of our recipient in a format that 
shall allow us to retrieve the information by reference to the name of the recipient. If the recipient 
is an established customer and has an account used for transmittals of funds, then the information 
also shall be retrievable by account number.

d. SAR Maintenance and Confidentiality (31 C.F.R. § 1022.320)
We will retain copies of all SARs filed and any supporting documentation for five years from the 
date of filing the SAR.
We will not notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported, 
except as permitted by the BSA regulations. We understand that anyone who is subpoenaed or 
required to disclose a SAR or the information contained in the SAR will, except where authorized 
by FinCEN, decline to produce the SAR or to provide any information that would disclose that a 
SAR was prepared or filed. We will notify FinCEN of any such request and our response.
We may share information with another financial institution about suspicious transactions in BankClient
order to determine whether we will jointly file a SAR according to the provisions of Section 4.e 
(above). In cases in which we file a joint SAR for a transaction that has been handled both by us 
and another financial institution, both financial institutions will maintain a copy of the filed SAR.
1. Education and Training Program (31 C.F.R. § 1022.210
(d)(3))
Under the direction of our AML Compliance Officer, we will provide ongoing education and 
training of appropriate personnel. This education and training will occur on at least an annual 
basis. It will explain the responsibilities of firm personnel under the firm’s AML compliance 
program, including education and training in the detection of suspicious transactions. If we have 
any branch offices or agents, we will ensure that they receive appropriate training.
Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags and signs of money 
laundering that arise during the course of the employees' duties; (2) what to do once the risk is 
identified (including how, when and to whom to escalate unusual customer activity or other red 
flags for analysis and, where appropriate, the filing of SARs); (3) what employees' roles are in the 
firm's compliance efforts and how to perform them; (4) the firm's record retention policy; and (5) 
the disciplinary consequences (including civil and criminal penalties) for non-compliance with 
the BSA.
We will develop training in our firm, or contract for it. Delivery of the training may include 
educational pamphlets, videos, intranet systems, in-person lectures and explanatory memos. We 
will maintain records to show the names of persons trained, dates of training, and copies of 
training.

1. Independent Review of AML Program (31 CFR §
1022.210 (d)(4))
The review of our AML compliance program will be performed annually (on a calendar year 
basis) by Securities Industry Records Services, LLC (“SIRS"), an independent, third-party service 
provider, or by another, similarly qualified, service provider. We have evaluated SIRS' 
qualifications to ensure they have a w orking knowledge of applicable requirements under the 
BSA and its implementing regulations.
