# 1. Set up the Backend (Express.js and Node.js)

Node.js will be your runtime environment.
Express.js will be your web application framework to handle HTTP requests.
**Connect to MongoDB:** Use Mongoose or the native MongoDB driver to connect to your database.
**Endpoint to Run Scripts:** Create an API endpoint in Express that triggers the Python scripts and returns their outputs. You might use the child_process module to execute Python scripts from Node.js.
**Store Results:** After a script runs, store its JSON output in MongoDB.
**Vector Embeddings:** To handle vector embeddings, you could use MongoDB's geospatial indexing or a dedicated vector database if you need more specialized vector search capabilities.

```bash
mkdir 2920 && cd 2920
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose axios body-parser cors --save
npm install cors
```

# 2. Develop the Frontend (React.js)
React App: Set up your React app to interact with the backend.
In the root directory 2920, run the following command to create a new React application in the client directory:

```bash
    npx create-react-app client
```
- Navigate to the client directory and install any additional packages you need for React.
- In the client package.json, set up a proxy to your backend server to simplify API requests during development.
- In the backend index.js, serve the static files generated by React's build process for production.
- **UI Components:** Create components to display the list of .md files, execute scripts, and display the output.
- **Fog Effect:** To present dictionaries in a "fog" that appears below the last one, you'll need to use CSS for the visual effects and React state to manage the appending of new data.

# 3. Integrate Python Scripts with the Backend
- **Python Execution:** The backend should handle requests to run specific Python scripts from the 2920Scripts directory.
- **Data Retrieval:** After script execution, the backend should send the resulting data back to the frontend.

# 4. Vector Database Integration
- **MongoDB:** Use MongoDB for basic data storage.
- **VectorDB:** If MongoDB doesn't meet your requirements for vector search, consider using a dedicated vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus, and connect it to your backend.

# 5. Connect Frontend with Backend
- **API Calls:** Use Axios or Fetch API in React to call backend endpoints.
- **Display Data:** Show the results from the Python scripts in an organized manner on the frontend. Consider using React virtualization libraries if the list gets too long, to maintain performance.

# 6. Deployment and Production Readiness
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, like HTTPS, CORS, input validation, and authentication.
- **Deployment:** You can deploy your MERN stack application on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start server.js
```

## Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create the full-stack application:

## 1. Initialize Node.js Project for Backend:

- Set up a new Node.js project with npm init.
- Install required packages: express, mongoose, axios, child_process, and any other necessary middleware.

## 2. Set Up Express.js Server:

- Create an Express server that handles HTTP requests.
- Set up routes to execute Python scripts using child_process and save outputs to MongoDB.

## 3. MongoDB Connection:

- Use mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database and define schemas for your data.

## 4. API Endpoints for Script Execution:

- Define endpoints in your Express server that can be called from the frontend to execute the Python scripts and return the JSON outputs.

## 5. Python Script Execution:

- Implement logic to run the Python scripts from the 2920Scripts folder and capture the output.

## 6. React.js Frontend Setup:

- Use create-react-app to initialize the React frontend.
- Create components to display the list of .md files, execute scripts, and display JSON outputs.
- Implement fog effect CSS and append new data to the list dynamically.

## 7. Vector Embeddings with MongoDB:

- Use MongoDB's geospatial indexing for basic vector embeddings or connect to a vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus.

## 8. Integration of Python Scripts:

- The backend should receive requests from the frontend and run the specified Python scripts.

## 9. Frontend and Backend Connection:

- Use Axios in your React application to make API calls to the backend endpoints.

## 10. Deployment:

- Prepare the application for deployment by ensuring security best practices are implemented.
- Deploy the application to the provided remote server 98-188-254-69.

# For folder placement:
- The index.js file is in your backend directory which is /home/cr8dl-user/2920wall/2920.
- The 2920Scripts directory should be at the same level as index.js or adjust the path in the script accordingly.
- The client directory should contain your built React app and be at the same level as your backend directory. This setup assumes you will build your React app and place the production build in the client/build directory.

- Make sure to replace <db-uri> with your actual MongoDB URI. The script assumes that you are running this server in a production environment with the environment variable NODE_ENV set to production. If that's not the case, you'll need to adjust the static files middleware accordingly.

- In development, you might not serve the React app through Express. Instead, you would run the React development server separately. When you're ready to deploy, you build your React app and serve it through Express as shown in the code above.
