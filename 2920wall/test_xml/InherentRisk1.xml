Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists."

Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

Wallace Bank Servicing Agent: Product: J. Wallace Bank BIN: GENERAL The term "section 314(a)" refers to section 314(a) of the law Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 Public Law 107- 1. J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a

Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770. If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immedi
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:ately notifies J. Wallace Bank. A Suspicious Activity Narrative is filed within 10 days. A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

The risk assessments are based on identification and

This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi

The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga

These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

Wallace Bank Servicing Agent: Product: J. Wallace Bank BIN: GENERAL The term "section 314(a)" refers to section 314(a) of the law Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 Public Law 107- 1. J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a

Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770. If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immedi
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:ately notifies J. Wallace Bank. A Suspicious Activity Narrative is filed within 10 days. A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J.

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga

These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide

Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi

The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls.

This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga

These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

Wallace Bank Servicing Agent: Product: J. Wallace Bank BIN: GENERAL The term "section 314(a)" refers to section 314(a) of the law Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 Public Law 107- 1. J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a

Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770. If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immedi

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide

Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans.

Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi

The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide

Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists." In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evide

Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

High risk customers are those who pose a higher risk to the bank due to their nature, location, or activities. The risk level is determined based on the bank's risk assessment and the level of due diligence required to manage the risk. The risk level may change over time based on changes in the customer's risk profile or the bank's risk assessment. The risk level is used to determine the appropriate level of due diligence required to manage the risk, including the level of monitoring and reporting required.

The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customer base. The bank must implement a robust risk management program to mitigate these risks. The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct. The risk assessment should also include a review of the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying and mitigating risks associated with high-risk customers.

The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni

Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus

Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem

Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga

These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a</Context>

The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

Risk Description: Electronic banking is a system that allows customers to conduct banking transactions electronically, such as online banking, mobile banking, and electronic funds transfers. This system is vulnerable to fraud and cybercrime, and banks must implement adequate security measures to protect customers' accounts and personal information. The risk level for code 'EB' is moderate because it involves the use of electronic systems to conduct financial transactions, which can be vulnerable to cyber threats. Banks must implement adequate security measures to protect customers' accounts and personal information.

Prepaid access products can be used to purchase goods and services, pay bills, or transfer funds. Prepaid access products are subject to the same anti-money laundering requirements as other payment products. However, because prepaid access products are often used by customers who do not have a traditional bank account, they may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing.

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. The buyer requests the bank to issue a letter of credit on the buyer's behalf, which guarantees payment to the seller if the buyer fails to pay. The risk associated with letters of credit is the potential for fraudulent activity, such as the buyer's failure to pay the seller, or the seller's failure to deliver the goods. The risk is also dependent on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the seller, as well as the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Letters of credit are commonly used in international trade transactions, and the risk associated with them can be higher due to the complexity of the transaction and the potential for fraudulent activity. &lt;s&gt;2&lt;/s&gt; 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller.

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a common form of payment in international trade. They are a promise by a bank to pay a beneficiary upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the letter of credit. The risk associated with letters of credit is that the bank may not be able to honor the letter of credit if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions specified. This could result in a loss to the bank and potentially to the customer. Letters of credit are typically used in international trade, and the risk associated with them is higher in countries with a higher risk of terrorist activity. &lt;s&gt;Risk Level: 2&lt;/s&gt;Risk

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. The buyer requests the bank to issue a letter of credit on the buyer's behalf, which guarantees payment to the seller if the buyer fails to pay. The risk associated with letters of credit is the potential for fraudulent activity, such as the buyer's failure to pay the seller, or the seller's failure to deliver the goods. The risk is also dependent on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the seller, as well as the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Letters of credit are commonly used in international trade transactions, and the risk associated with them can be higher due to the complexity of the transaction and the potential for fraudulent activity. &lt;s&gt;2&lt;/s&gt; 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller.

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a common form of payment in international trade. They are a promise by a bank to pay a beneficiary upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the letter of credit. The risk associated with letters of credit is that the bank may not be able to honor the letter of credit if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions specified. This could result in a loss to the bank and potentially to the customer. Letters of credit are typically used in international trade, and the risk associated with them is higher in countries with a higher risk of terrorist activity. &lt;s&gt;Risk Level: 2&lt;/s&gt;Risk

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a common form of payment in international trade. They are a promise by a bank to pay a beneficiary upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the letter of credit. The risk associated with letters of credit is that the bank may not be able to honor the letter of credit if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions specified. This could result in a loss to the bank and potentially to the customer. Letters of credit are typically used in international trade, and the risk associated with them is higher in countries with a higher risk of terrorist activity. &lt;s&gt;Risk Level: 2&lt;/s&gt;Risk

Risk Description: Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. The buyer requests the bank to issue a letter of credit on the buyer's behalf, which guarantees payment to the seller if the buyer fails to pay. The risk associated with letters of credit is the potential for fraudulent activity, such as the buyer's failure to pay the seller, or the seller's failure to deliver the goods. The risk is also dependent on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the seller, as well as the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Letters of credit are commonly used in international trade transactions, and the risk associated with them can be higher due to the complexity of the transaction and the potential for fraudulent activity. &lt;s&gt;2&lt;/s&gt; 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches

Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS

Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans.

This can include investment management, trust services, and other specialized financial services. The risk associated with private banking is higher due to the potential for increased complexity and potential for higher risk exposure. Private banking clients may have a higher level of sophistication and knowledge of financial markets, which can make it more difficult to assess their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Additionally, private banking clients may have a higher level of assets under management, which can increase the risk of fraud and other financial crimes.

Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and

This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS

Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi

The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS

WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing is moderate due to the fact that the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J.

Risk Description: Moderate risk. The risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing is moderate due to the fact that the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an individual factor does not necessarily indicate a high overall risk rating. However, the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing is higher than the average risk rating for private banking due to the fact that the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings.

Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW

Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on

Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans.

FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML &amp; OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW 
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi
FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec

Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e

The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.

Private banking involves providing financial services to high net worth individuals, family offices, and other private investors. This can include investment management, trust services, and other specialized financial services. The risk associated with private banking is higher due to the potential for increased complexity and potential for higher risk exposure. Private banking clients may have a higher level of sophistication and knowledge of financial markets, which can make it more difficult to assess their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Additionally, private banking clients may have a higher level of assets under management, which can increase the risk of fraud and other financial crimes. Private banking clients may also have a higher level of leverage, which can increase the risk of market volatility and other market risks.

Risk Description: Monetary instruments are a common means of money laundering and terrorist financing. The use of monetary instruments can facilitate the movement of funds across borders, making it difficult to trace the funds. Monetary instruments can also be used to purchase goods and services, making it difficult to identify the true source of the funds. The risk level for code MI is 2 because it is a common means of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the use of monetary instruments can facilitate the movement of funds across borders and make it difficult to trace the funds. &lt;s&gt;FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in determining whether to establish or maintain an account.&lt;/s&gt;

Risk Description: The risk level for code 'NP' is moderate. The search of TCI's records to identify accounts of a named suspect and the comparison to the master file and internal purged accounts database may result in a higher risk of fraudulent activity. The use of a one-time search and the lack of ongoing monitoring may also increase the risk of fraudulent activity. However, the fact that TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank may indicate that the risk is not extremely high.

Risk Description: SAR filings are a critical component of the BSA/AML compliance program. The frequency and nature of SAR filings can indicate the effectiveness of the bank's risk management and compliance programs. The bank's ability to identify and report suspicious activity is a key indicator of its ability to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The bank's SAR filings may indicate a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, particularly if the bank is filing SARs at a higher rate than industry averages. However, the bank's SAR filings may also indicate a higher level of due diligence and risk management, particularly if the bank is filing SARs at a lower rate than industry averages. The bank's SAR filings should be reviewed in conjunction with other risk factors to determine the overall risk level.</Risk Rationale>
