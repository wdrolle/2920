and to detect suspicious transactions ; and  
 
• processes to be followed when transaction moni toring  systems  
detect  potentially suspicious activity.  
This Compliance Policy  must be followed unless there are exceptional 
circumstances justifying a variation.  
If an employee consider s that this Compliance Policy  is not applicable 
for an activity covered within the scope of this document, the 
individual must seek permission from the responsible MLRO or their 
approved delegate before deviating from this Complia nce Policy . 
A failure to follow this Compliance Policy could severely harm

of the licences necessary to operate our business. Any such failure may 
result in disciplinary action or termination for any employee found to 
have breached this Com pliance Policy  and may constitute a criminal 
offence.

• Customer Due Diligence  Policy ;  
• Merchant and Distributor Due Diligence  Policy ; and  
• Escalation and SAR Policy . 
This Compliance Policy  primarily focuses on European regulations, and 
sets a minimum group -wide standard, based on the strictest law within 
the EU. If specific local regulations, outside of the EU, require higher 
standards or stricter provisions, the local entity will always co mply 
with such local regulations. Less strict rules will only be implemented 
if they have a clear legal basis, are accepted by local supervisory 
authorities (where appropriate), and are approved by the  responsible  
MLRO.

1. Ongoing Transaction Monitoring  
 
J. Wallace Bank monitor s all transactions (by customers, merchants and 
distributors) on an on -going basis  using  a risk -based approach. The 
intensity of our monitoring  depend s on the level and nat ure of the 
risks identified by Group Compliance . Where a higher risk of money 
laundering or terrorist financing is detected a more enhanced and 
focused approach is used and stricter thresholds and measures are 
implemented.  
 
J. Wallace Bank’s  transaction monitoring systems can detect suspicious 
activity based on money laundering and terrorist financing typologies 
and indicators. Based on our risk assessment of products, users, 
countries and delivery channels, we have identified potential high risks 
for J. Wallace Bank which we mitigate through stringent transaction 
monitoring.  
 
Our monitoring processes consist of  ongoing transaction monitoring 
through both assurance checks and automated transaction monitoring 
using rules that reflect our experience of  potentially suspicious 
transactions by:  
 
• use of our known  money laundering, terrorist financing and 
other illegal activity typologies (see Escalation and SAR Policy ); 
 
• identify ing discrepancies between submitted and detected data 
(for example th e IP addre sses used and the user’s country or 
origin);  
 
• cross referencing  submitted data against that for other accounts 
(for example credit cards used by multiple holders);  and  
 
• use of  systems that interface with third party sources to detect

criminal activities . 
 
If you identify  potentially suspicious behavior, you must  follow the 
process set out in Escalation and SAR Policy  to determine if any 
Internal SAR must  be made . 
 
We monitor transactions both in real time (i.e. when  a tra nsaction is 
about to take place)  as well as after the event, when  the transaction 
has already been executed. For this purpose J. Wallace Bank has defined 
several thresholds and rules and implemented automated reports with 
predefined criteria.  
 
As such, our transaction monitoring processes are desi gned to detect  
suspicious activities based on money laundering and terrorist financing 
typologies and indicators. The implemented thresholds, rules and 
reports are also based on the Compliance Department’s r isk 
assessment.  
 
4.1. Review and update of J. Wallace Bank mon ey laundering and 
terrorist financing typologies  
The Compliance  Department is responsible for ensuring that 
the money laundering, terrorist financing or other illegal 
activity typologies that relate to J. Wallace Bank products  are 
updated to reflect our ongoing experience.  
 
As such, the Compliance Department must  confirm to the 
responsible MLRO each quarter  that the:  
 
• typologies being used to identify potentially suspicious 
activity are current  and standardized across our 
busin esses to the extent appropriate given our risk 
assessment ;

• these typologies are reflected in our systems’ rules.

Monitoring must  include a review of any applicable systems  
rules to ensure  that: 
 
• the rules remain relevant  and current ; 
 
• new rules are incorporated into the system promptly 
and effectively ; 
 
• the rules are correctly applied ; and 
 
• our system s are operating effectively.  
 
In addition, t he output of alerts from the systems  must  be 
sample checked on a quarterly  basis to ensure that the
