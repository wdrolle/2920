1. Introduction  
 
It is J. Wallace Bank’s policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and 
ethical manner.  
The purpose of this Compliance Policy  is to assist all employees by  
clearly setting out the processes that must be followed if anyone  has: 
• suspicions that a J. Wallace Bank product is being used for money 
laundering, terrorist financing or other criminal activities ; 
 
• reasonable grounds to suspect that any attempted, upcoming, 
ongoing or previously conducted transaction involving J. Wallace Bank  
products may constitute criminal conduct or have involved the 
proceeds or funding of criminal activity.  
This Compliance P olicy  must be followed unless there are exceptional 
circumstances justifying a variation.   
If an employee considers that this Complian ce Policy  is not applicable 
for an activity covered within the scope of this document, the 
individual must seek written permission from the responsible MLRO  or 
their approved delegate before deviating from this Compliance P olicy . 
A failure to follow this Compliance Policy  could severely harm 
J. Wallace Bank’s reputation, financial standing and possibly breach the terms 
of the licences necessary to operate our business. Any such failure may 
result in disciplinary action or termination for  any employee found to 
have breached this Escalation and SAR  Policy  and may constitute a 
criminal offence.  
This Compliance Policy  supersedes all previous group policies 
regarding  Escalation and SARs  and is supplement ed by  the Escalation 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 7 
and SAR Guidance N otes . It should be read together with the :  
• J. Wallace Bank Code ;  
• Global Compliance Policy ; 
• Customer Due Diligence  Policy ;  
• Merchant and Distributor Due Diligence  Policy ; and  
• Transaction Monitoring and Investigations  Policy . 
This Compliance Policy  primarily focuses on European regulations, and 
sets a minimum group -wide standard, based on the strictest law within 
the EU. If specific local regulations, outside of the EU, require higher 
standards or stricter provisions, the local entity will always co mply 
with such local regulations. Less strict rules will only be implemented 
if they have a clear legal basis, are accepted by local supervisory 
authorities (where appropriate), and are approved by the responsible 
MLRO.  
A glossary of define d terms is included at section 8  of this Compliance 
Policy .

This Compliance P olicy  applies to all J. Wallace Bank  employees , directors and 
non-executives as well as all other work ers who work with us (whether 
as consultants, secondees, volunteers, sponsors or otherwise).  
 
1. Nominated Officer – Proceeds of  Crime Act  2002  (POCA)  
 
J. Wallace Bank Group has the responsibility to appoint a Nominated Officer  in 
accordance with  the Proceeds of  Crime Act 2002 (POCA), of sufficient 
seniority.   
The POCA is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which 
provides for the confiscation or civil recovery of the proceeds from crime 
and contains the principal money laundering legislation in the UK.  
J. Wallace Bank nominated the VP Regulatory Compliance team  as a Nominated 
Officer who is responsible for:  
 
• receiving reports of suspicious activity from any 
employee in the business ; 
• considering all reports and evaluating whether there is 
- or seems to be - any evidence of money laundering or 
terrorist financing ; 
• reporting any suspicious activity or transaction to the 
National Crime Agency (NCA) by completing and submitting 
a Suspicious Activity Report ; 
• asking the NCA for consent to continue with any 
transactions that they’ve reported, and making sure that no 
transactions are continued illegally ;

4.1. Money laundering  and terrorist financing  
Whilst there are specific definitions of “money laundering” 
and “terrorist financing” set o ut in the relevant legislation, in 
J. Wallace Bank we define m oney laundering  and terrorist financing 
together as:  
 
“Possessing, or in any way  dealing with, or concealing, the 
proceeds of any crime. It also involves similar activities 
relating to, terrorist funds, which include funds that are likely 
to be used for terrorism, as well as the proceeds of terrorism .” 
 
4.2. Our experience  
We have found a number of recurring money laundering , 
terrorist financing or other illegal activity  typologies that 
relate to J. Wallace Bank products. These almost all relate to various 
types of fraudulent activities that are “predicate offenc es to 
money laundering” (i.e. crimes  which underlie money 
laundering) or other illegal activity including terrorist 
financing . 
 
Based on our experience, we have identified certain activities 
that we treat as suspicious or high -risk (or very high -risk). If 
we identify such activity , we will investigate further and, if 
appropriate, notify the relevant authorities  following the 
process set out in this Compliance P olicy . 
4.3. High -risk activities  
A transaction is treated as high -risk or suspicious if it does 
not fit behavioral patterns asso ciated with the average 
member  (customer, merchant o r distributor) of J. Wallace Bank 
products. Behavioral patterns derive from historical data 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 10 
available to J. Wallace Bank. Transactions may also be defined as 
high -risk based on an analyst’s experience whenever new or 
evolved fraud patterns have been identified.  
 
A high risk or suspicious transaction must  be investigated to 
see whether it shows one of the following components:  
 
• fraud, theft or other known illegal activity;  
 
• breach of the contract terms between J. Wallace Bank  and 
merchants (or distributors) ; 
 
• breach of the contract terms between J. Wallace Bank and 
customers;  
 
• patterns of activity that cannot be explained for 
legitimate commercial reasons and that appear 
consistent with money laundering or other criminal 
activity.  
 
These patterns of activity do not always indicate that 
suspicious activity has in fact taken place. You must  always,  
however, investigate such observed suspicious patterns to 
determine what the causes of the pattern are likely to be.  
 
Depending on the risk  associated with the patterns ( e.g. the 
volume of money involved, or a high degree of similarity to a 
recent activity already determined to be suspicious) , we may  
choose to block involved vouchers, accounts or customers 
while we carry out our investigation . 
 
We will file a SAR , following the process set out in paragraph 
5 below , when we have : 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 11 
 
• suspicions that a merchant, distributor or customer 
account is being used for money laundering, terrorist 
financing or other criminal activity;  or 
 
• reasonable grounds  to suspect that any attempted, 
upcoming, ongoing or previously conducted 
transaction involving J. Wallace Bank products may constitute 
criminal conduct or involve the proceeds or funding of 
criminal activity.  
 
You must  ensure that you are familiar with the guidance 
includ ed in this Compliance Policy : 
 
• Appendix 2 sets out the key traits of an e-money 
launderer.  
 
• Table 1 of Appendix 3 gives further guidance (based on 
our J. Wallace Bank business’ experience) of key traits of 
suspicious activity.  
 
• Appendix 4 explains some of the key money 
laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activity 
typologies that we are aware of.  
 
1. Our internal reporting process  
 
There is a statutory obligation on all employees to report suspicious 
transactions , activity or content .  
This Compliance P olicy  sets out the policy that must  be followed to 
escalate concerns that an account may be  being used for money 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 12 
laundering or terrorist financing.  
On escalation, the Regulatory  Compliance Dep artment  must   decide 
what further verification steps are to be taken or if the case needs to 
be reported  to law enforcement agencies. A record of all internal 
money laundering reports must be kept to ensure proper record 
keeping  and must be sent to the MLRO for Management Information .  
Our Internal Reporting Process  can be summarized as follows ( Figure 
1): 
 
 
5.1. Suspicious activity identified  
All employees  are responsible for  identify ing suspicious 
transactions , activity or content . 
 
• Suspicious activity must be reported as an Internal SAR 
to sar@J. Wallace Bank.com . 
 
• The AML Investigation Team must review the internal 
suspicious  activity following the steps below to 
confirm the suspicion and then  prepare the SAR report

other applicable Financial Intelligence U nit (FIU)) . 
Regulatory  Compliance reviews and submits  the 
report to the NCA /applicable FIU  on behalf of the 
MLRO.  
5.2. Who is the r esponsible MLRO ? 
The responsible MLRO  with J. Wallace Bank are : 
 
• The Group MLRO of J. Wallace Bank  Group  or in his /her  
absence his /her  deputy ; 
 
• Germany MLRO for business of “J. Wallace Bankcard.com 
Deutschland, Zweigniederlassung der Pr epaid Services 
Company Limited”;   
  
• Swiss  MLRO for business of “J. Wallace Bankcard.com Schweiz 
GmbH” and MENA DMCC ; 
 
 
5.3. Investigative steps to be considered  
The exact steps to be followed when investigating potential 
suspicious activity  will depend on the circumstances and 
nature of the suspicion. In particular, when determining the 
appropriate level of investigation, you must  take into 
account the nature of:  
 
• the initial referral;  
 
• the suspicion itself ; 
 
                                                        
1 NCA is the FIU for the UK.  
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 14 
• the degree of clarity around the suspicious activity ; 
 
• the number of accounts /products  concerned ; 
 
• contact from the customer ; 
 
• the products being used; and  
 
• the extent of knowledge about the account /products (s) 
concerned.  
The goal of all investigations and Internal SARs  review 
process  is to fully understand the activity a customer is using 
our products and services for, establish the customer ´s 
profile, define the suspicious behaviour or activity, 
investigate and document all relevant data and then provide 
a reasonable conclusion to aid the responsible MLRO (or duly 
authorised deleg ate) to determine if escalation to the 
authorities is appropriate.  
The following steps should  be followed when compiling a n 
Internal  SAR. These steps must  be considered in light of the 
Recommended Content of an Internal SAR (see paragraph 
5.4 below) : 
 
• an initial review is carried out of the relevant 
account(s) /product  customer  info section, transaction 
history, finan cial details, comments section, duplicates 
info, log -in information, KYC on file.  
 
• Member accounts linked by account information, 
behaviours  and/or memb er to member relationships are 
thoroughly reviewed  following a risk -based approach .  
 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 15 
• Transaction details are analysed to establish transactional 
behaviours or patterns, or changes in them, to identify 
possible suspicious transactions; often th e entire account 
history may look suspicious. When looking at transaction 
history, a number of criteria may need to be reviewed 
including: products being used,  risks as sociated to those 
products; and any subsequent associated source of funds 
information.  
 
• Sources of such information may include , inquiries with 
the payment processing teams, the business units, 
merchant enquiries, peer mates, and/or account review 
with the member.  
 
• The comments section of a member’s account is an 
ongoing archive of the member ’s data. The investigator 
can observe previously documented links, previously 
listed personal and financial information which has been 
changed, documentation collected/KYC notes, recorded 
email and live person exchanges, etc., all of which 
contribute to un derstanding the member’s profile.  
 
• Bank information or credit/debit card associated to the 
account should be observed.  
 
• Searching a member’s login IPs can be useful in 
establ ishing common IP users. For the purpose of a 
review, it is generally beneficial to  set the date range for 
one year.  
 
• Any known business relationships associated to the 
account (may be determined in the account review phase, 
noted in comments, flagged as an affiliate, business name 
in email domain, etc.) shou ld be taken into consideratio n. 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 16 
 
• Web  search  should be used to search for any possible 
adverse information.   
• Review of the Responses  of the member . 
 
• If KYC documents are relevant to the investigation, they 
should be reviewed for authenticity and the conclusion 
clearly noted in the Internal SAR. If they are deemed in 
some way to be fraudulent or questionable, copies will be 
placed into the SAR folder.  
 
• The SARs register  must be completed with all pertinent 
information. A n Internal  SAR form  must be populated, 
including a free form nar rative summary of findings, and 
any conclusion (or lack thereof) about the activity that 
was reported as suspicious. Should the responsible MLRO 
(or duly authorised delegate)  decide to escalate the case, 
the escalation would take place as soon as practicab le. 
 
5.4. Content of an Internal SAR  
You must  follow the recommended content checklist set out 
in Appendix 1 (Internal SAR checklist).  
5.5. Failure to make an Internal SAR 
A failure to make, without reasonable excuse, a report about 
a suspicious transaction is a breach of an employee ’s 
employment  contract and may have disciplinary 
consequences. It may also constitute a criminal offence2. 
                                                        
2 Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002  (POCA 2002) , it is a criminal offence for a 
person working in the regulated financial sector, if they fail to report where they have 
knowledge , suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion that another 
person is laundering the proceeds of any criminal c onduct.  
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 17 
5.6. Tipping off  
It is a criminal  offence for anyone to take any action to 
prejudice an investigation by informing the person who is  or 
might be  the subject of a suspicion report, or anybody else, 
that a disclosure has been made, or that the police or 
customs authorities are carrying out or intending to carry out 
a money laundering investigation3.  
This means that you must not  make any disclosure or do 
anything that you suspect might prejudice any investigation 
the police or other authorities may be undertaking  
The responsible  MLRO  (or duly authorised delegate)  must  
decide  (on a case -by-case basis ) how best to communicate 
with a suspicious customer /merchant (or distributor)  to 
ensure compliance with the se tipping off rules  but at the 
same time avoid complaints to escalate (e.g. block ed 
accounts).  
1. Our external reporting process  
 
We are required to report promptly  to the National Crime Agency  
(NCA) (as well as any other applicable financial intelligence unit (FIU)) 
any suspicious transactions and to maintain our internal control 
system  so that suspicious transactions can be verified.  
6.1. Who is responsible for external reporting?  
The responsible MLRO (or duly authorised delegate ) is 
responsible for submittin g Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs ) 
to the NCA  and J. Wallace Bank’s  other external money l aundering

Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 18 
reporting duties ( although  any employee  remains 
responsible to report any suspicious activity internally).  
The MLRO must  keep proper records of any decision not to 
make a report to the NCA . 
 
6.2. MLRO review  
The responsible MLRO (or duly authorised delegate)  must 
review the Internal SAR  without undue delay. All internal 
report s received by the responsible MLRO must  be recorded 
on the internal ”MLRO dashboard”.  
 
The MLRO may  then require further investigation (e.g. to 
contact the customer, merchant or  distributor involved 
asking for further information). The MLRO may  also ask for 
additional blocking/unblocking actions to be taken in 
connection with the Internal SAR, and must  record in writing 
the reasons for such requests.  
 
The responsible MLRO must  decide, in a timely manner, 
whether the available information provides sufficient 
grounds for reasonable suspicion to meet the standard 
required for filing a SAR with the financial intelligence unit 
(FIU) in the appropriate country. If that standard is me t, the 
responsible MLRO must  file an accurate, thorough, 
informative and timely SAR with the relevant FIU in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines and to complete any 
other notifications required to relevant  regulatory bodies in 
the MLRO’ s area of responsi bility.  
 
The responsible MLRO must ensure  that these actions are 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 19 
carried out in a timely and competent manner.  
 
If the responsible MLRO decides that the available 
information does not provide sufficient grounds for filing a 
SAR with the relevant FIU, the MLRO must  document in 
writing  the reasons for that decision.  
 
 
 
1. Communication and disclosure of information  
 
Once it has been decided that reasonable grounds for suspicion exist:  
 
• you must not  give any further information to external parties 
(other t han law enforcement and authoris ed regulatory 
entities) ; 
 
• the customer , merchant or distributor  may be notified that the 
account is still under account review , but must not  be told that 
suspicious activity is suspected or is being reviewed.  
All informati on connected with Internal SARs and the detection of 
suspicious activity must  be kept confidential wi thin J. Wallace Bank and must 
not be shared with other employees unless necessary for them to carry 
out their job.  
1. Ongoing monitoring of SAR escalations and decisions  
 
The Compliance  Department  seeks to ensure that timely, accurate, risk 
sensitive decisions are being made about how best to comply with our 
obligations and ensure that appropriate activity is identif ied and, as 
necessary reported.  
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 20 
Periodic spot checks are made of accounts where pot entially 
suspicious activity has been identified and the process and decisions 
taken are reviewed by the Compliance Department . This includes 
cases in which the decision has been taken not to file a SAR with 
external bodies, to ensure that such decisions a re being taken and 
documented appropriately.  
The results of these reviews are reported to the responsible MLROs, 
the Group MLRO and the J. Wallace Bank Audit Committee .

KEY TRAITS OF AN E -MONEY LAUNDERER  
• Cross border transactions (IP Mismatches, Company Structure, 
Multiple Bank Accounts)  
 
• Layering of casino winnings won by multiple accounts connected to 
a master account controlling the scheme  
 
• Irregular or Short Term Account Usage. E.g. High value deposit, 
stays dormant for 6 months then withdrawn  
 
• U Turn Transactions – Money Passes from one person or company 
to another, and back to the original person or company  
 
• High Value One -off Transactions with no real explanation  
 
• Member is defensive when requested ID documents  
 
• Merchant activities are susp ect based on URL check ( in breach of 
the J. Wallace Bank Group Terms and Conditions , the w ebsite does not 
contain privacy statement, no legal documents supplied, missing 
Terms and Conditions, not registered with other regulated e -
money payment options)  
 
• Comments on account from the Fraud Department   
 
• Multiple accounts with no identity documents, false identity 
documents or spurious registration details. E.g. incomplete 
telephone numbers, irregular postal codes, nonsensical first and 
last names.  
 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 25 
• Suspect Country T raits – e.g. IP’s registered from countries such as 
considered high risk (e.g. see Merchant and Distributor Due 
Diligence Policy ).  
 
Please take note that the above criteria are a strong indicator, but 
it is also limited in its application and none of the above have to be 
present in order to identify an E - money launderer.

APPENDIX 3 
FURTHER GUIDANCE ON SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY  
TABLE 1 : FURTHER GUIDANCE ON SUSPICIOUS  ACTIVITY  
Suspicious 
Activity  
 Description  Trait  
Non -delivery 
(confirmed)  Suspect ecommerce URL or auction merchant selling goods 
that are subsequently not delivered.  The sellers usually sell 
their products and services by advertising them in social 
media and forums.  The merchant withdraws profits or sends 
to another account to start up a similar operation.  The sellers 
are usually unable to provide with delivery proof if such is 
requested for justifying the receipt of a  particular payment.  
In confirmed non -delivery cases the money launderer 
creates the URL or auction site to defraud multiple buyers (> 
5 complaints received). In a different variation of the scam 
the fraudster takes over a genuine auction site to process 
orders without delivering. Take over cases are achieved using 
phishing attacks, when the fraudster has gained access to an 
auction seller ID and password.  Non -response to ID request, multiple 
comp laints as goods never dispatched, and the 
merchant  has gone out of business, withdraws  
the profits of latest orders (previous good 
history), transactions serve a short -term 
purpose.  
 
Fraud 
Proceeds 
laundered  In these cases, the money launderer creates a set of multiple 
accounts using stolen identities to fraudulently obtain funds. 
A stolen identity (also known as “ID Fraud” or “ID Theft”) is 
when a fraudster has accessed a name, address and the 
financial detai ls of a victim he intends to defraud. How the 
fraudster collects and uses this information depends on his 
own creativity. In the section “Phishing Attacks” the most 
common method of identity theft is discussed.  
Once the fraudster has control of the victim ’s account he 
sends stolen funds to connected accounts. To disguise the Western European name and address, address 
verification  fails by name and/or post code , IP 
mismatch with country of registration, 
Occasionally Mr. <female>, connected to other 
accounts by : similar emails, ‘passmates’, IP 
Mates, date of birth , time of registration, 
transaction pattern and ZIP  code . When dialing 
telephone number person unknown by 
recipient.  
Escalation and SAR Policy

fraud,  he splits the payments, and then skims under 
transaction verification limits to avoid detection. Commonly, 
stolen identities are Western European or US profiles, with a 
transact ion limit of 1000 EUR. Eventually, the money 
launderer will collect the funds, and then withdraw to his 
own bank account. Or, he will use a stolen identity to buy 
resalable goods such as Voice -Over IP credits, lottery tickets, 
virtual game credits and web design templates.  
  
Betting fraud 
controller 
(BFC)  A betting fraud controller is the main suspect account who 
collects the pay -outs generated by fraudulent activity at a 
betting firm. J. Wallace Bank  ensure s confirmation that pay -outs are 
generated by fraudulent activity is received from the casino. 
This means the  casino will confirm either that a chargeback 
is received that confirms fraud; or that forensic evidence 
proves multiple accounts are connected (Forensic evidence 
includes password mates, IP mates and time of registration).  
 Winnings paid out simultaneously in similar 
values to a set of multiple accounts created 
using stolen Western European identities. The 
stolen identities are connected by IP or 
‘passmates’ and have no prior funding via the 
J. Wallace Bank  account. Fraudulent pay -outs are then 
collec ted by a main account or group with high -
risk country traits.  
 
Credit card 
fraud 
laundered 
(CC/ML)  A credit card fraud controller is similar to Betting Fraud, 
except that the main suspect collects the credit card fraud 
proceeds directly from the victim’s  accounts.  
 In a related scheme, CC payments are often 
from a set of cards with a similar BIN range 
(banking identification number is the first six 
digits of the card number). This type of CC fraud 
is known as ‘Credit Master Fraud’, which means 
a series of valid CC nu mbers are generated 
using a program that predicts card numbers, by 
analysing the algorithms of previously issued 
cards. Alternatively, CC/ML activity is a result of 
a Phishing Attack.  
Fraudulent Credit Card uploads will eventually  
Escalation and SAR Policy

result in chargeback. A chargeback is when the 
genuine card holder contacts the card issuer 
(e.g. Visa, Amex, MasterCard) to dispute a card 
transaction.  
 
Bank wire 
fraud 
laundered  A bank wire fraud controller is the main suspect account, 
who collects the proceeds of bank wire fraud deposits, into 
an account held with J. Wallace Bank .  
Bank wire fraud payments are usually connected to an 
auction platform. In these cases, the fraudster tricks the 
victim into sending money via bank transfer to pay for non -
existent goods. The fraudster will provide the customer with 
a reference to initiate the bank transfer. The reference is the 
customer account ID of J. Wallace Bank , created by the seller 
(fraudster) using the delivery address provided by the 
auction buyer (victim).  
The victim enters  the exchange in good faith, under the 
impression that wire transfer funds will be received by the 
fraudster. Concern arises when the victim receives his bank 
statement which displays the J. Wallace Bank  debit. Bank wire fraud 
cases are reported either by the vict im, bank or the police 
investigating the case. Any available balances are refunded 
to the victim.  
 Suspect connected to associate victim by 
password, similar emails, registered IP Address, 
time of registration, similar customer ID range, 
and transaction p attern. Bank Wire uploads of 
similar value in all associate victim accounts; 
then sent to main suspect account 
simultaneously.  
 
False ID  Suspicion of False ID sent in to verify an account held with 
J. Wallace Bank  e.g. Passport, driver’s license or identity card - 
blurred ID, low resolution copy, coat of arms omitted; 
signature or font appears in a courier typographic, photos 
are not aligned, MRZ  (Machine Readable Zone)  does not Linked by device, IP, password, time of 
registration, transa ction pattern and address –

match the data in the document, the document template 
does not exist, details such as photograph, colouring, stamps 
look out of place. Depending on the quality of the false 
document it can be hard to spot.  
Employees authorised to complete document verifications 
undergo document verification training. According to the UK 
Fraud Act 2006, an offence is committed once false identity 
documents are submitted (Fraud Act 2006 (2) Fraud by false 
representation).  
Most common cases of false identification are related the 
verificat ion of groups of fake accounts created for the 
purpose of promotion abuse. To receive more bonuses, a 
bonus abuser must create a large number of accounts that 
will be funded from one master account where the real 
details of the abuser will be registered. T he other accounts 
will attempt verification with fake documents. When asked 
for explanation of activity, the customer provides unclear 
information that does not explain the transaction history.  
  
Phishing 
Attacks  Phishing attacks are predominantly designed by the 
fraudster to facilitate identity theft in order to ‘hack’ 
member  accounts and defraud them. The Account Take Over 
(Controller) uses spoof emails to trick the member  into 
disclosing their login details. The fraudster has altered the 
sender field of the e mail to make the victim think that the 
J. Wallace Bank  Group customer serv ices is requesting further 
information. Once the victim clicks on the Link to “update” 
information a fake website is displayed. The fake website will 
replicate the home page of the J. Wallace Bank  Group. Except t he 
URL supplied is not ww.J. Wallace Bank .com.  
Often the Account Take Over (Controller) never reveals their Merchant or customer complains account is 
“hacked” or lost balance. IP address reveals 
suspect last login not  consistent with usual 
pattern of activity. Primary email address 
changed by fraudster. Series of false identities 
used to receive unauthorised payments, then 
subsequently sent to sports books/casinos or 
VOIP. Alternatively , fraudster receives 
payments the n withdraws to his bank account.

Finance receives notification from the bank, or an instant 
payment method such as Bibit, that cheques  are stolen and

Images hosted anywhere in the world. It is “an offence in the 
UK “to take, permit to be taken, make, possess, show, 
distribute or advertise indecent images of children. Indecent 
should be taken as its dictionary meaning; as a guide it means 
any images of children, apparently under 18 years of age, 
involved in sexual activity or posed to be sexually 
provocative”.  
It is illegal both to distribute and to purchase indecent images 
of children. In particular , merchants offering a child modeling 
service must be automatically referred to the Compliance 
Department . Child modeling services can host private 
member pages with a pay per view opportunity. We report 
indecent images to both the Internet Watch Foundatio n and 
to NCA.

forwarded on by the exchanger to a company based off shore 
with little or no CDD (Know Your Customer) requirements.  
Although Money Exchange can be a genuine activity, 
unregulated money exchange is regarded as  unacceptable at 
J. Wallace Bank. An exchanger is reported when associate activity is 
predominantly related to any other high risk suspect. E.g. 
Pyramid Seller, Account Take Over (Victim) money, Credit 
Card or Bank Wire fraud.  
 Payment instruction indicates “exchange”, 
account serves short term use, email address 
contains key words such as “forex” or “trader”.

Pyramid 
selling  Pyramid selling is illegal in the UK. A Pyramid seller will 
promote rewards or bonus pay -outs to subscribers using 
multi -level marketing, get rich schemes, au to surf or high 
yield investment programs (HYIP). Legal low risk customer 
referral schemes can involve multi levels and are free to join.  
 To be confirmed as a pyramid seller, the scheme 
will involve more than two “levels” in the 
commission structure, pai d membership and 
recruitment of new members.  
 
High risk 
transactions  When a new member  deposits ≥ EUR 10,000 we will request ID plus Postal Address Verification and an 
explanation.  
We request ID, address verification documents and a reason for the deposit for any first time high value deposit 
(≥ EUR 10,000). The deposit can only be processed upon approval from the MLRO or Compliance Department.  
 
Terrorism  J. Wallace Bank pays special attention to vulnerable industries such as charities, to prevent terrorist funding 
opportunities. On the surface terrorist funding will usually appear genuine, so it is therefore essential that 
effective Know Your Customer / Customer Due Dilig ence (CDD) checks are completed for all members . 
Additionally, for charities we collect the government registered charity number. For example: www.charity -
commission.gov.uk. By collecting CDD documents, we can respond appropriately to any potential police 
investigations.

APPENDIX 4 
FURTHER GUIDANCE ON SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY  
Below are examples of patterns of behaviour which would be regard ed as 
unusual activity and that may form the basis for investigation and 
ultimately a SAR.  
It should be note d that these patterns do not always indicate that 
suspicious activity is taking place. As such, when one of these suspicious 
patterns appears, further investigative steps  must be taken  to determine 
what the causes of the pattern are likely to be.  
a) Combinati on of multiple means of payment issued by J. Wallace Bank 
Group entities  
Several means of payment issued by J. Wallace Bank Group offer financial 
services that can be combined or used to top up respective balances:  
- J. Wallace Bankcard vouchers can be used to top up myJ. Wallace Bankcard  
accounts  
- myJ. Wallace Bankcard accounts can be used to top up Skrill wallets, 
Neteller wallets as well as J. Wallace Bankcard prepaid MasterCards  
- credit  cards can be used to cashout funds from Skrill and Neteller 
wallets  
The review of money laundering patterns and the review of involved 
individuals has shown that often a variety of means of payment is utilized 
for layering purposes when laundering money.  Bearing in mind that each 
money transfer adds costs for the end -user (fees deducted from the 
balance for every m oney transfer), questions arise related to the benefit 
of customers. Furthermore, knowing that the mentioned accounts and 
wallets offer almost the same access to webshops, checking for the add -
on value the customer aims for by transferring money is advisab le. 
There is behavior that can indicate possible money laundering intention:  
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 34 
- Newly registered myJ. Wallace Bankcard account customers who transfer 
money from their account to a Skrill or Neteller wallet as a first 
activity (instead of using any myJ. Wallace Bankcard accou nt services or 
frequenting any webshops directly with their myJ. Wallace Bankcard 
account).  
- Transfer of payouts from a myJ. Wallace Bankcard account to a Skrill or 
Neteller wallet, instead of using the cashout functionality or credit  
card with the myJ. Wallace Bankcard account di rectly.  
Logins to the myJ. Wallace Bankcard accounts or the registration itself showing 
different geo location details than the payment or money transfer 
activities themselves.  
b) Clustering of residential addresses (account registrations)  
We have found that, when a pplication fraud occurs, there will often be an 
unusually high number of payment accounts registered using the same or 
similar residential addresses. When multiple applications are registered 
in this way, there are typically a very small number of individu als actually 
controlling the accounts. As a result, they normally use a relatively small 
number of computing devices when setting up the accounts.  
Residential addresses are also available with point of sales (POS). When 
analyzing patterns the review of PO S locations can provide further 
evidence of linked individuals.  
c) Clustering of similar registration data (account registrations)  
Just as with clustering of residential addresses, we have found that groups 
of fraudulent account registrations often show clusters of similar 
usernames , email addresses  and security questions and answers  provided 
at registration. As with clusters of similar residential addresses, we find 
that clustering of usernames , email addresses  and security questions and 
answers  is highl y associated with fraudulent activity.  
d) Large transactions at a small set of merchants from a single device 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 35 
or IP address, where IP address and/or browser language do not 
match issuing country  
Whenever a large transaction volume at a single merchant, or a t a small 
set of merchants, coming from a single device or single IP address  is 
observed , there is a heightened risk that the transaction volume may 
represent suspicious activity.  
However, in the absence of additional factors, such increased volume may 
simply represent a  ”high roller”. One factor which increases the index of 
suspicion is a mismatch between the country of the IP address, and/or the 
language used in the browser settin gs, and the country where the account 
was set -up from.  
Mismatches between the IP address country and the country of account 
registration is more significant than “mismatch” between country of 
account registration and browser language, as in every country there will 
be substantial minorities who are most comfortable using a language 
other than an official language of the country in which they live. However, 
when this type of suspicious behavior occurs, often there will be a very 
specific set of characterist ics which recur across all transactions in the 
pattern, and consistent use of a specific browser language which is not an 
official language of the country where the account was opened is often a 
consistent characteristic across all transactions in a suspic ious group.  
Often, a highly specific pattern will be identified upon analysis, that will 
have a large enough number of distinctive features (which, in normal 
transaction activity, do not all typically appear together), and which is 
found to occur across m ore than one device and/or IP address.  
e) Spike in transaction volumes at a specific merchant  
A large spike in transaction volumes at a merchant is a high -risk pattern 
which is cause for concern, even when other known indicators of 
suspicious activity are not present. Whenever such a spike is detected, 
Escalation and SAR Policy   
 
 
 36 
enquiries must be made with the merchant conce rning any knowledge 
they have about the abnormal transaction volumes, and investigation 
must be made to determine whether the transactions can be linked to 
other known suspicious activity.  
There can be many reasons why this type of spike may occur, and no t all 
of them are suspicious. As with the pattern described in the preceding 
section, this type of activity can result from a legitimate high roller who 
was not previously using our payment method or was using a different 
merchant. A spike could also occur  as the result of a promotion that drives 
additional traffic. It is important to understand all of the known factors 
which may account for a spike before making a determination that the 
transaction activity is suspicious and, therefore, reportable.  
f) High v olumes of ATM withdrawals on a single payment account  
An ATM facility is available only for accounts which have an associated 
physical MasterCard. Our experience with legitimate customers shows 
that it is very uncommon for them to make large or frequent A TM 
withdrawals. In cases involving suspicious ATM withdrawals, the pattern 
usually involves loading the account and then withdrawing the cash via 
ATM as soon as possible.  
Often, the ATM withdrawals take place in a city located at a considerable 
distance f rom the residential address provided at registration for the 
account, and sometimes several such accounts (i.e. showing high ATM 
withdrawals and possible application fraud) can be linked together due to 
the presence of ATM withdrawals at ATMs located withi n the same small 
geographic area. The index of suspicion is also raised if the ATM 
withdrawals take place in a different country from the one in which the 
payment account was issued, as this can indicate use of the payment 
account to transfer funds cross -border.
