Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770. If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immedi\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:ately notifies J. Wallace Bank. A Suspicious Activity Narrative is filed within 10 days. A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed. Version Revised By Brief Summary of Changes Revision Date 1 Paul Fretham New Policy 5/6/19 Last Annual Review Completed by on Next Review Date: 6/1/2020\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML & OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Wallace Bank Servicing Agent: Product: J. Wallace Bank BIN: GENERAL The term \"section 314(a)\" refers to section 314(a) of the law Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 Public Law 107- 1. J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770. If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immedi\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:ately notifies J. Wallace Bank. A Suspicious Activity Narrative is filed within 10 days. A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed. Version Revised By Brief Summary of Changes Revision Date 1 Paul Fretham New Policy 5/6/19 Last Annual Review Completed by on Next Review Date: 6/1/2020\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML & OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

The risk assessment should include a review of the bank’s customer base, including the geographic location of customers, the types of businesses they operate, and the types of transactions they conduct.

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance. While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise. Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

J. Wallace Bank provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks. Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any. Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list. If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770.

Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent \"watch lists.\" In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated. Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314 (a) subject need only be \"reasonably suspected\" based on credible evide\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:nce of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering. Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

Upon review \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md:of the files, TCI conducts a one- time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect. The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to J. Wallace Bank. A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.md: match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ngs, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s cus\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tomers, products, services, and geographies. As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following: Number of cash-intensive business customers; Number of SARs filed for cash structuring; Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA; Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and rem\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ote deposit capture; Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations. Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE. As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following: Volume of higher risk NRA customers; Wire transfers from international locations; International ACH transactions However, due to the mitiga\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ting controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW. These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues. The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA a",

The buyer requests the bank to issue a letter of credit on the buyer's behalf, which guarantees payment to the seller if the buyer fails to pay. The risk associated with letters of credit is the potential for fraudulent activity, such as the buyer's failure to pay the seller, or the seller's failure to deliver the goods. The risk is also dependent on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the seller, as well as the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.

The buyer requests the bank to issue a letter of credit on the buyer's behalf, which guarantees payment to the seller if the buyer fails to pay. The risk associated with letters of credit is the potential for fraudulent activity, such as the buyer's failure to pay the seller, or the seller's failure to deliver the goods. The risk is also dependent on the creditworthiness of the buyer and the seller, as well as the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Letters of credit are commonly used in international trade transactions, and the risk associated with them can be higher due to the complexity of the transaction and the potential for fraudulent activity. <s>2</s> 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller. 2 2 Letters of credit are a type of financial instrument that enables a bank to act as a guarantor for a buyer's payment to a seller.

The risk associated with letters of credit is that the bank may not be able to honor the letter of credit if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions specified. This could result in a loss to the bank and potentially to the customer.

Version Revised By Brief Summary of Changes Revision Date 1 Paul Fretham New Policy 5/6/19 Last Annual Review Completed by on Next Review Date: 6/1/2020\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:BSA/AML & OFAC Annual Risk Assessments Assessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016 Overview J. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni",

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place. Executive Summary The risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earni",

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.

As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J.

Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk.

Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties.

The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.

Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW \nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include on\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:e to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundat\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ion in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function. Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md: measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function. The BS\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:A/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an indi\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:vidual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk. The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effec\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:tiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit. Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to e\nFYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.md:ffectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.
